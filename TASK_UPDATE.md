Set up and tested the Flask backend (app.py) by installing dependencies and running the server locally.
Created a GROQ account and generated API keys to replace placeholders in the code for authentication.
Installed missing dependencies (flask, groq, transformers, serverless-wsgi, torch) to resolve module import errors.
Resolved Python PATH issues by manually installing packages and ensuring script executables were accessible.
Attempted to install TensorFlow but encountered compatibility issues with Python 3.13, suggesting a downgrade to Python 3.10/3.11 for TensorFlow support.
Successfully ran the Flask application, verifying API endpoints and AI response generation via GROQ API.
Encountered warnings related to symlinks in Hugging Face cache but proceeded as caching still functioned.
Verified that the AI response generation (POST /generate_answer) worked as expected, ensuring correct model behavior.
Identified areas for improvement, such as securing API keys with an .env file and optimizing response handling for efficiency.
Final Status: The project is set up successfully, all tests passed, and AI responses are working
