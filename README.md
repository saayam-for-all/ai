# Saayam For All AI Services (AWS Lambda)

A suite of serverless backend services built on AWS Lambda that provides context-aware AI capabilities, classification, search, and emergency contact resolution for the Saayam platform.

These services run independently as separate Lambda functions or under a single unified routing Lambda function.

---

## Architecture & Deployment Model

This codebase supports two hosting paradigms:
1. **Unified Endpoint Routing**: Routing all service requests through a single entry point (`lambda_function.lambda_handler`) using a `"service"` selector parameter.
2. **Independent Microservices (Recommended)**: Deploying five separate AWS Lambda functions sharing the same deployment package, each pointing to its own dedicated handler entry point.

### Handlers & Configurations

| Lambda Service | Entry Point Handler | Recommended Memory | Recommended Timeout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Predict Category** | `lambda_function.predict_category_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Subject** | `lambda_function.generate_subject_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Answer** | `lambda_function.generate_answer_handler` | 1024 MB | 60 seconds |
| **Emergency Contacts** | `lambda_function.emergency_contacts_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **More Organizations** | `lambda_function.search_orgs_handler` | 512 MB | 45 seconds |

## Environment & Secrets Configuration

All services leverage **AWS SSM Parameter Store** (and IAM Roles) to access keys rather than exposing them as raw environment variables.
* **SSM Parameter Names**:
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/groq/key` (Groq API Key)
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/gemini/key` (Gemini API Key)

## Service Details & curl Test Cases

### 1. Predict Category
Classifies description text into a ranked list of help categories.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/predict-category \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
  }'
```

---

### 2. Generate Subject
Generates a short, descriptive subject line from a user's request details.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-subject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
  }'
```

---

### 3. Generate Answer
Generates structured context-aware responses to user help requests based on database records.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
  "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
  "conversation_history": []
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
    "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
    "conversation_history": []
  }'
```

---

### 4. Emergency Contacts
Resolves matching emergency numbers based on query parameters (latitude/longitude, zipcode, or IP geolocation).

#### request Payload (Body or Query string)
```json
{
  "zip": "95112",
  "country": "US",
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### curl Command (POST)
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zip": "95112",
    "country": "US",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

#### curl Command (GET query fallback)
```bash
curl -X GET "https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts?zip=95112&country=US&language=en"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "services": {
    "general_emergency": { "dial_number": "112", "display_number": "११२", "source": "directory", "is_fallback": false },
    "fire":              { "dial_number": "101", "display_number": "१०१", "source": "directory", "is_fallback": false },
    "women_helpline":    { "dial_number": "112", "display_number": "११२", "source": "general_emergency_fallback", "is_fallback": true }
  },
  "language": "hi",
  "country": "IN",
  "match_level": "country",
  "resolved_location": { "country": "IN" }
}
```

- `dial_number` is always ASCII and is what a click-to-call link must use.
  `display_number` is the same number in the requested language's numerals.
- `is_fallback` is `true` when the directory holds no entry for that service in
  that country and the country's own general emergency line is being returned
  instead. Label those rows as a general emergency line rather than presenting
  them as the specific service.
- Numbers never cross a border. If the country cannot be resolved, or the
  country is not in the directory, the endpoint answers `404` rather than
  returning another country's numbers. **Clients must render "unavailable" in
  that case and must not substitute a default of their own** — a hardcoded
  `911` or `988` is the safety violation described in
  [issue #146](https://github.com/saayam-for-all/ai/issues/146).
- Pass `service=<name>` to request a single service. Recognised names are
  `general_emergency`, `police`, `ambulance`, `fire`, `disaster_management`,
  `women_helpline` and `suicide_helpline`.

Provenance for the numbers in `services/emergency_numbers.json` is recorded in
[`docs/emergency_numbers_provenance.md`](docs/emergency_numbers_provenance.md).

### 5. More Organizations
Returns 6 verified organizations (3 nonprofit, 3 for-profit) close to the user's location related to their request.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "subject": "shelter",
  "description": "i am on the streets now i dont have a place to stay please help",
  "location": "San Jose, CA"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/more-organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "shelter",
    "description": "i am on the streets now i dont have a place to stay please help",
    "location": "San Jose, CA"
  }'
```

## CI/CD GitHub Actions Deployment

Any push to the `dev` branch triggers the multi-job parallel deploy workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy_aws_lambda.yml`. 

To ensure successful deployments, define the respective AWS credentials (`*_ACCESS_KEY`, `*_SECRET_KEY`, and `*_LAMBDA_ARN`) as repository action secrets in GitHub.
