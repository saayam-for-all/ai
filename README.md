# Saayam AI Services (AWS Lambda)

A suite of serverless backend services built on AWS Lambda that provides context-aware AI capabilities, classification, search, and emergency contact resolution for the Saayam platform.

These services run independently as separate Lambda functions or under a single unified routing Lambda function.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Deployment Model

This codebase supports two hosting paradigms:
1. **Unified Endpoint Routing**: Routing all service requests through a single entry point (`lambda_function.lambda_handler`) using a `"service"` selector parameter.
2. **Independent Microservices (Recommended)**: Deploying five separate AWS Lambda functions sharing the same deployment package, each pointing to its own dedicated handler entry point.

### Handlers & Configurations

| Lambda Service | Entry Point Handler | Recommended Memory | Recommended Timeout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Predict Category** | `lambda_function.predict_category_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Subject** | `lambda_function.generate_subject_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Answer** | `lambda_function.generate_answer_handler` | 1024 MB | 60 seconds |
| **Emergency Contacts** | `lambda_function.emergency_contacts_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **More Organizations** | `lambda_function.search_orgs_handler` | 512 MB | 45 seconds |

## 🔑 Environment & Secrets Configuration

All services leverage **AWS SSM Parameter Store** (and IAM Roles) to access keys rather than exposing them as raw environment variables.
* **SSM Parameter Names**:
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/groq/key` (Groq API Key)
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/gemini/key` (Gemini API Key)

## 🧪 Service Details & curl Test Cases

### 1. Predict Category
Classifies description text into a ranked list of help categories.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/predict-category \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
  }'
```

---

### 2. Generate Subject
Generates a short, descriptive subject line from a user's request details.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-subject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
  }'
```

---

### 3. Generate Answer
Generates structured context-aware responses to user help requests based on database records.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
  "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
  "conversation_history": []
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
    "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
    "conversation_history": []
  }'
```

---

### 4. Emergency Contacts
Resolves matching emergency numbers based on query parameters (latitude/longitude, zipcode, or IP geolocation).

#### request Payload (Body or Query string)
```json
{
  "zip": "95112",
  "country": "US",
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### curl Command (POST)
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zip": "95112",
    "country": "US",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

#### curl Command (GET query fallback)
```bash
curl -X GET "https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts?zip=95112&country=US&language=en"
```

---

### 5. More Organizations
Returns 6 verified organizations (3 nonprofit, 3 for-profit) close to the user's location related to their request.

#### request Payload

## 🚀 CI/CD GitHub Actions Deployment

Any push to the `dev` branch triggers the multi-job parallel deploy workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy_aws_lambda.yml`. 

To ensure successful deployments, define the respective AWS credentials (`*_ACCESS_KEY`, `*_SECRET_KEY`, and `*_LAMBDA_ARN`) as repository action secrets in GitHub.
