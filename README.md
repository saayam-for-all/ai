# Saayam For All AI Services (AWS Lambda)

A suite of serverless backend services built on AWS Lambda that provides context-aware AI capabilities, classification, search, and emergency contact resolution for the Saayam platform.

These services run independently as separate Lambda functions or under a single unified routing Lambda function.

---

## Architecture & Deployment Model

This codebase supports two hosting paradigms:
1. **Unified Endpoint Routing**: Routing all service requests through a single entry point (`lambda_function.lambda_handler`) using a `"service"` selector parameter.
2. **Independent Microservices (Recommended)**: Deploying five separate AWS Lambda functions sharing the same deployment package, each pointing to its own dedicated handler entry point.

### Handlers & Configurations

| Lambda Service | Entry Point Handler | Recommended Memory | Recommended Timeout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Predict Category** | `lambda_function.predict_category_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Subject** | `lambda_function.generate_subject_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **Generate Answer** | `lambda_function.generate_answer_handler` | 1024 MB | 60 seconds |
| **Emergency Contacts** | `lambda_function.emergency_contacts_handler` | 256 MB | 15 seconds |
| **More Organizations** | `lambda_function.search_orgs_handler` | 512 MB | 45 seconds |

## Environment & Secrets Configuration

All services leverage **AWS SSM Parameter Store** (and IAM Roles) to access keys rather than exposing them as raw environment variables.
* **SSM Parameter Names**:
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/groq/key` (Groq API Key)
  - `/dev/saayam/GenAI/gemini/key` (Gemini API Key)

## Service Details & curl Test Cases

### 1. Predict Category
Classifies description text into a ranked list of help categories.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/predict-category \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help with tutoring in math"
  }'
```

---

### 2. Generate Subject
Generates a short, descriptive subject line from a user's request details.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-subject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Need help finding and leasing the best apartment  in San Jose under 1500$ budget"
  }'
```

---

### 3. Generate Answer
Generates a structured, context-aware response to a help request. Backs the
**More Information** button on the Request Details page.

The database is a *source* of the request text, not a precondition. Send the
text you already have and the request row is never read; send identifiers and
the row is read to fill in what is missing. See issue #169.

#### request Payload — text supplied by the caller (no database read)
```json
{
  "subject": "Need winter coats",
  "description": "Two children, no warm clothing, snow forecast next week.",
  "location": "Chicago",
  "category": "Clothing",
  "conversation_history": []
}
```

#### request Payload — looked up from the request row
```json
{
  "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
  "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
  "conversation_history": []
}
```

`user_id` also accepts `userId`, `req_user_id`, `beneficiary_id`,
`beneficiaryId` and `userDBid`. `req_id` also accepts `request_id`,
`requestId` and `id`, which is what the Request Details page holds. At least
one of the two payload styles must be satisfied: either `subject` **and**
`description`, or `user_id` **and** `req_id`.

#### Response
```json
{ "answer": "<markdown>", "source": "request" }
```

This method uses **non-proxy** integration, so the client reads
`response.body.answer`. `source` is `"request"` when the text came from the
payload and `"database"` when it came from the request row.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Answer generated |
| 400 | Neither text nor identifiers supplied, or the body is not a JSON object |
| 404 | No request row for that `user_id` / `req_id` |
| 503 | `REQUEST_STORE_UNAVAILABLE` — Postgres is down; retryable |
| 502 | `ANSWER_GENERATION_FAILED` / `ANSWER_EMPTY` — the model failed |

A model failure is never reported as a 200. Driver-level database errors are
logged to CloudWatch and never returned to the caller.

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/generate-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "SID-00-000-02-356",
    "req_id": "REQ-00-000-000-0377",
    "conversation_history": []
  }'
```

---

### 4. Emergency Contacts
Resolves matching emergency numbers based on query parameters (latitude/longitude, zipcode, or IP geolocation).

#### request Payload (Body or Query string)
```json
{
  "zip": "95112",
  "country": "US",
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### curl Command (POST)
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zip": "95112",
    "country": "US",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

#### curl Command (GET query fallback)
```bash
curl -X GET "https://<api-gateway-url>/emergency-contacts?zip=95112&country=US&language=en"
```

---

### 5. More Organizations
Returns 6 verified organizations (3 nonprofit, 3 for-profit) close to the user's location related to their request.

#### request Payload
```json
{
  "subject": "shelter",
  "description": "i am on the streets now i dont have a place to stay please help",
  "location": "San Jose, CA"
}
```

#### curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/more-organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "shelter",
    "description": "i am on the streets now i dont have a place to stay please help",
    "location": "San Jose, CA"
  }'
```

## CI/CD GitHub Actions Deployment

Any push to the `dev` branch triggers the multi-job parallel deploy workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy_aws_lambda.yml`. 

To ensure successful deployments, define the respective AWS credentials (`*_ACCESS_KEY`, `*_SECRET_KEY`, and `*_LAMBDA_ARN`) as repository action secrets in GitHub.
